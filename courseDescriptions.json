However, these digital signal processing techniques will be supplemented by analog signal processing techniques will be supplemented by analog signal processing techniques, which continue to be important for front-ends of receivers (and will remain important as carrier frequencies continue to migrate to higher frequencies).

","EE 685":"The emphasis will be on the design of the transmitter and receiver sections of a wireless system, but antenna design will also be covered to provide an understanding of the techniques used to achieve directional and steerable antennas when appropriate for the given wireless system. The wide range of carrier frequencies seen in wireless systems leads to a variety of semiconductor and other technologies being required at different carrier frequencies. In addition, the bandwidth of the signal leads to substantially different issues arising in the packaging used for the transmitter and receiver ends. For lower carrier frequencies, advanced silicon IC technologies are preferred, given the maturity of the technology and the considerable density of both analog and digital circuitry that can be integrated on a single IC. At higher frequencies, the limits of contemporary silicon technologies are encountered, leading to use of specialized semiconductor technologies such as GaAs and SiGe circuits. In addition, the difficulty of realizing high accuracy analog/digital conversions at multi-GHz frequencies leads to a preference, at this time, for analog for analog circuitry at the higher frequencies. On the other hand, analog/digital conversions are becoming possible at sufficiently high sampling rates that digital processing is being strongly pursued directly at the front end of a receiver, allowing a variety of new techniques to be considered for the overall receiver design. In cases where front-end digital signal processing cannot be achieved, such digital processing is increasingly used at intermediate frequencies (i.e., the IF section). In the case of data communications, digital techniques are almost certainly used at baseband, for example to separate the data signal from the received analog signal, to perform data decoding, etc. The course will include material related to contemporary digital signal processor technologies, supplementing the discussions in Course 2 by considering in greater depth the physical design and performance limitations of technologies and architectures.

Students will be expected to produce and present three net art projects over the course of the semester, including one final project that must be launched online. Students are not expected to have previous programming experience but should already be familiar with the digital imaging, audio, and/or video tools necessary to produce media that they wish to include in their projects. While this course will introduce students to some of the technologies used by net artists, it should not be taken as a programming class, and cannot be used as an equivalent to technical courses offered by other departments. ","HAR 460":"As the highest level course offered in the Game Design concentration for Visual Art and Technology, this course is structured to give advanced students the opportunity to develop from the ground up a complete, well-polished, ready-to-market game.

This course approaches its subject matter from the artist¹s standpoint and is taught by a professional artist. ","HAR 490":"An internship is a short-term work experience that emphasizes learning. It is an essential way to try out a career, develop new skills, combine academic theory with “hands-on” experience, and build up a resume. This is an independent and individually-initiated program of work arranged between the student and an institution, organization, or business. Internship requires a plan (prepared with the job supervisor) to be presented to the Internship faculty sponsor, per approval, in the Program in Art & Technology, outlining the scope of work before starting the internship. It is expected that Internship will run approximately 8 to 12 hours per week for 14 weeks (or 112 to 168 hours per academic session) per 3 credits. A scheduled bi-weekly meeting with a group to discuss internships and career interests is expected. The student’s internship performance will be evaluated by the following: a) a weekly journal describing the student’s involvement in various activities and projects; b) an approximately five-page reflective essay in which the student integrates prior coursework with the internship experience (a theory and practice exercise); c) a basic report indicating the extent to which scope of work was accomplished; d) attendance and participation in group meetings; e) a written evaluation from the student’s supervisor; f) a portfolio of work accomplished during the internship, if appropriate.
